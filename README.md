üèÇ CARVE stands for Cluster-Aware Routines for Versatile Embedding and provides a flexible toolbox of implementations of algorithms for tailored and effective application of cluster-aware embedding techniques. This code was developed by Dr. Amanda Buch and Dr. Logan Grosenick in the Grosenick lab at Weill Cornell Medicine.


CARVE is a novel framework that simultaneously performs joint clustering and embedding by combining standard embedding methods using a convex clustering penalty in a modular way.

üîÖ Currently CARVE is composed of the following algorithms (Please cite Buch et al., AISTATS 2024):

Pathwise Clustered Matrix Factorization (PCMF). PCMF implements cluster-aware principal component analysis on a single-view dataset. 
Locally Linear Pathwise Clustered Matrix Factorization (LL-PCMF). LL-PCMF implements cluster-aware locally linear embedding on a single-view dataset. 
Pathwise Clustered Canonical Correlation Analysis (P3CA). P3CA implements cluster-aware canonical correlation analysis on two-view datasets.
